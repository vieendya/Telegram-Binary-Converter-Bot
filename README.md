Bot: https://t.me/NumberSystemConverterBot

This is a telegram bot that works to convert the number system. Supports all number systems (Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal)

Example I'll take number 100011101(2), it's from Binary.

This is an example:
I want convert 100011101 from Binary (base 2) to Hexadecimal (base 16), so the message that should be sent to the bot is /convert 2 16 100011101 and bot will return the result with 11d

It's all the result if converting from 100011101:
- 100011101(2) » Binary
- 435(8) » Octal
- 285(10) » Decimal
- 11d(16) » Hexadecimal
